            I am Debbie Macasiano, graduated as a Human Biologist and now aiming
            to be a Full-Stack Web Developer. My goal is not only to make
            compelling designs, but to make sure that all aspects of back-end
            are overseen with precision. I plan to take it one step at a time,
            by acquiring all the knowledge and skill set of a front end designer
            before I move to more complex technicality. In the long run, I see
            myself as a professional Web Developer with the perfect blend of
            Front and Back End experience.
            <br />
            <br />I believe that programming advances all the time, and it takes
            a dedicated amount of effort to keep up with the latest trends. As I
            continuously improve and understand different ways to approach web
            design, I also make sure that I am not just maintaining the website
            to ensure its performance. Coding means being able to act quickly
            and solve analytical problems. I am determined to keep learning
            while making sure that my attitude towards growth infinitely expands
            until I reach my goal of being an expert in my chosen area of
            interest.
